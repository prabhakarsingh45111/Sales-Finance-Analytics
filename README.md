# 🌍 Air Pollution Market & Product Analysis

This repository contains my **first unguided project** for the **Codebasics Resume Challenge** (powered by DataFul), where I analyzed air pollution trends, market demand, and product requirements for **AirPure Innovations**, a startup aiming to launch an air purifier in India.

## 📜 Project Overview
India has **14 of the world’s 20 most polluted cities**. Before launching their air purifier, AirPure Innovations needed answers to critical questions:
1. Which pollutants should the purifier target?
2. What essential features should be built into the product?
3. Which cities have the highest demand & market size?
4. How can R&D align with localized pollution patterns?

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify target pollutants and high-demand regions.
- Recommend features based on pollution profiles & consumer pain points.
- Prioritize cities for market entry based on AQI severity, population density, and purchasing power.
- Use data to align product strategy with market needs.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning, filtering, and trend analysis.
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards, AQI pattern visualization, market segmentation, and heatmaps.
- **Data Sources** – Govt AQI datasets, WHO reports, market studies.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Identified top pollutants (PM2.5, PM10) and seasonal patterns across cities.
- Recommended essential purifier features like HEPA filters, VOC sensors, and smart air quality monitoring.
- Created a **Market Prioritization Score** to rank cities for potential launch.

## 📚 Key Learnings
- How to independently manage a research project from **problem statement to actionable insights**.
- Importance of data visualization in decision-making.
- Linking market research with technical feasibility for product success.
